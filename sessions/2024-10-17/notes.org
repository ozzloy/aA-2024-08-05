* relationships in a database
** one-to-one
one row in table A references exactly one row in table B

*** example
one user in Users table references one settings collection in settings
table

** many-to-many
*** book people example
  + each person can read multiple books
  + each book can be read by many people
*** a way to connect a many to many relationship is a 3rd table
  + the table is a join table
  + just has ids from 2 other jables
  + the same id can appear multiple times in the left column,
    and another id can appear multiple times in the right column
    + in the example, this would be the same person reading mulitple
      books, and the same book being read by multiple people

** one-to-many
  #+begin_src sql
    CREATE TABLE students (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT
    )

    CREATE TABLE puppies (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT,
      date TEXT,
      student_id INTEGER,
      FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
    );
  #+end_src

** =FOREIGN KEY= relates column in one table to column in another table
  typically something like =student_id= in current column is related
  to =id= column in the students table.

** =DELETE CASCADE=
  delete triggers delete of all related records
