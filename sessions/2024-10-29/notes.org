* sequelize
  + do very specific queries on db
  + don't get a lot of stuff and sort it out in js
    rather than finding all the users and then sorting the result in js,
  + make sure the sql query returns them sorted already.
  + use index on columns you search often
  + refactor to eliminate N+1 queries
  + paginate responses

* search filters
  + send query strings in url
  + GET /sofas?color=light+brown&minWidth=71&design=modular
    + endpoint is GET /sofas
    + get req.query to get color, minWidth, design

* practice
  + pagination
  + search filters

  + long practice: sequelize in the real world

* pagination practice
* search query practice
