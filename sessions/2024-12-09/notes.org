* python
#+begin_src bash
  mkdir new-proj
  cd new-proj
  pipenv install Flask
#+end_src
pipenv creates a new virtualenv for the project
#+begin_src bash
  wget -O .gitignore \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/refs/heads/main/Python.gitignore
#+end_src

=project-dir/backend/app/app.py=
#+begin_src python
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__) # instantiate the server

  @app.route("/")
  def home():
      pass
#+end_src

to make endpoints, use =@app.route(ROUTE_HERE)=

and then you create a function that you want to run when the route is
hit.  Whatever this function returns will be sent back as a response

to run the flask server, all you need to do is run the command
#+begin_src bash
  flask run
#+end_src
however, you need env variables for this command to work.

because you need to tell flask where the server is.

the environment variable that you need is FLASK_APP=filename.py

we need to install python-dotenv in order to be able to read these
env variables

the environment variable that you need is ~FLASK_APP=filename.py~

NODEMON equivalent for flask -> add an env var FLASK_DEBUG=true

=project/.flaskenv=
#+begin_src bash
  FLASK_APP=server.py
  FLASK_DEBUG=true
#+end_src
