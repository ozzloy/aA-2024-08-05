** efficiency
  + connecting to a db takes time
  + db is on a server somewhere else
    + not the same server running the rest of the app code, for example
    + so every query means doing a full network round trip
    + so cramming things into single query is often worth the effort
    + getting just the necessary data can be worth the effort
      + sending a small amount of data is faster than sending a large amount

  const petArr = ["dog", "cat", "parrot"];

    // of elements in petArr
